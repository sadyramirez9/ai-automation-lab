Narrator:
So here’s how the birth of Jesus Christ went down. Mary was engaged to Joseph. Before they were married, Mary was found to be pregnant—and the child was from the Holy Spirit.

Joseph:
(aside) I’m a decent guy. I don’t want to shame her. I’ll end this quietly.

Narrator:
While Joseph was turning this over in his head, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream.

Angel:
Joseph, son of David—relax. Don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife. What’s happening here is from the Holy Spirit. She will have a son. You will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.

Narrator:
All of this happened to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:

Angel:
“Look—the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son,
and they will call him Immanuel.”

Narrator:
Which means, “God with us.”

Joseph:
(waking up) Okay. I’m doing this.

Narrator:
Joseph did exactly what the angel told him to do. He took Mary as his wife, but he did not have relations with her until she gave birth to a son. And he named him Jesus.
